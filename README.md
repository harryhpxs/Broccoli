## Test cases

### Form input validation

All following cases would be tested before submitting the form.

- #### Name

    Name takes 3 to 50 characters from `[A-Za-z ]` including spaces in the middle.

- #### Email

    Email input is tested by Regex pattern:

    ```javascript
    /[a-z0-9!#$%&'*+/=?^_`{|}~-]+(?:\.[a-z0-9!#$%&'*+/=?^_`{|}~-]+)*@(?:[a-z0-9](?:[a-z0-9-]*[a-z0-9])?\.)+[a-z0-9](?:[a-z0-9-]*[a-z0-9])?/
    ``` 

- #### Email matching

    Two email input fields are tested to be matched.

### DOM Event

- #### Button onClick

    All buttons have been tested to trigger correct functions, including: 
    - `Request to invite` @Main
    - `Send` @PostForm
    - `Ã—` @PostForm
    - `OK` @DoneBox.

### Networking

- #### POST request

    The form submission POST request is handled by [axios](https://github.com/axios/axios).

    - `200 OK` &rarr; Show DoneBox
    - `400 Bad Request` &rarr; Display error message at form bottom
